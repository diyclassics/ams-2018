<p>As mentioned in the introduction, all aspects of ancient world study at this point bear "the imprint of digital technology." While this has brought about access to the kinds of cutting-edge research tools and resources that are showcased at Ancient MakerSpaces, it has not been without challenges. We have gathered together a diverse panel of digital practioners in ancient world study, whose interests range from digital development and infrastructure to publication of digital critical editions and other online texts to quantitative research in Classics to the use of social media for outreach and related topics. Our panel will discuss these issues as well as the general state (and future) of digital work in Classics.</p>
