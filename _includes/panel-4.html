        <p>The Homer Multitext project aims to make the full complexity of the textual transmission of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> accessible to scholars and undergraduates by means of high-resolution images of the historical manuscripts that transmit the poems, together with digital diplomatic editions of their contents. The HMT thus extends the work of Milman Parry and Albert Lord by taking advantage of the possibilities offered by digital editing, computational processing, and electronic publishing in order to present the Homeric texts in a way in which the oral, traditional nature of the epics can be better appreciated and investigated. It also empowers scholars and undergraduates to engage in collaborative research and the creation of openly licensed data. In this workshop we will provide an overview of the project and the data currently available to users, and then go on to demonstrate how researchers can take advantage of the HMT's citation structure to create data models using stable and permanent identifiers (URNs).</p>
